# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack

Since we own both attacker and target EC2 instances GuardDuty detected two seperate threats.

- For attack instance, it reports that one of our EC2 instances performing an SSH brute force attack. 
  This is a very usefull insight, because EC2 instance's security might be breached and someone could've 
  taken control of our EC2 instance.
- For target instance, it reports that one of our EC2 instances getting SSH brute force attacked. It reports
  some useful information like attack origin, effected instances, timeframe of attack etc.  

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

AWS guardduty continously monitors for malicious and unauthorized behaviour. It automatically analyze network and account activity
using data like CloudTrail logs, VPC Flow Logs, DNS logs etc. GuardDuty combines managed rule-sets , threat intelligence from 
AWS Security and 3rd party intelligence partners, anormally detection, and machine learning to intelligently detect malicious and 
unauthorized behaviour. For this particular SSH brute force attack, AWS guard duty detected abnormal traffic on port 22 by analyzing VPC flow 
logs and reported it.
