# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

We can reduce attack surface by moving web app instance to a private subnet and only allow connections via internet gateway.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

No, using VPC endpoints doesn't prevent unauthorized access.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

No, we need to manually apply encryption to existing files.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

All of the changes that we've done would be reverted. It is a best practice to apply infrastructure 
changes via code if the organization adopted a infrastructure as code tool like cloudformation.
