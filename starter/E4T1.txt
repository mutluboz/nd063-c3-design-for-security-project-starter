# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

Most of the ports that is used frequently by attackers are open to the internet on this instance. SSH
brute force attacks can be prevented by restricting access to SSH ports. We can provision a bastion host for 
accessing our EC2 instances via SSH and make SSH ports usable by only that bastion host by configuring network ACL. 


# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

- We need to restrict API access rights to S3 resources. Our application only needs to access free recipes but has access to all S3 buckets.
- By restring API access we secure the secret recipe bucket. But our free recipe bucket is still vulnerable and attackers can access all data
  in this bucket if the API key has been compromised. We can enable S3 server side encyrption with customer managed keys to prevent this scenerio.
